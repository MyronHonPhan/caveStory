	 In every object that is visible on the GUI, there will always be a update and

	 1) draw is going to blit the surface (take the source image and copy it
	 to our destination through SDL_RenderCopy)

	 2) update is going to update the frames of the animation since there could
	 be many frames to an animation like walking

	 3) once that is done, then we will SDL_RenderPresent which will update the
	 entire frame

	 main loop :

	 update which frame -> render copy (copy pixels) -> render present (update frame)
